# Modern C++ features

We define here as "modern C++" features the ones introduced since C++11. These features should be used in a "controlled" form in Firebird code, as not all compilers fully support them.

Only ones mentioned in this document could be used, but as necessities appears, discussion should be started in the devel list.
